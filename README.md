# Kristie Fisher-Portfolio

<h1>Description</h1>
Welcome this is my portfolio!<br>
this project helped me utilize the tools and skills I have learned so far in bootcamp. <br>
This was my first time starting a webpage from scratch, I had to incorporate a user friendly interface within the webpage.<br>
 I had to put links into an image of my first project, add images, customize text, and navigate links to sections to personalize it to fit my style. <br>
I plan on using this Portfolio to add upcoming challenges to progress my skills and help me further my career.

<h2>User Story</h2>
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

<h3>Acceptance Criteria</h3>
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
